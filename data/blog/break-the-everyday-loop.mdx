# How do average people become exceptional?

Many fail to realize their day doesn't start in the morning rather the night before. When you sleep determines when you'll wake up and the amount of energy you'll have throughout the day. Starting your day off at the right time and with the right energy levels is the most important and the first step to becoming exceptional.

After you have figured out your sleeping schedule, which by the way does not have to be sleep at 10 pm and wake up at 5 am. Every single person has a different day going on and whatever best fits the day you plan is the route you should take. Keywords in that last sentence are "you plan", with this in mind you must plan out every single day to maximize your efficiency and growth.

If you want to become exceptional, you must look at yourself as a business and your everyday life as your agenda. Create a plan for every hour of everyday. Sleep atleast 6 hours a day. Eat well throughout the whole day. On top of all this, you must further your skills. At the end of the day, find something to better yourself. Never stop learning. 

After you have created a plan, routine and goals, make sure to honestly evaluate yourself. This is where people grow the most if done correctly. If you are not honest to yourself, all this will go to waste. Evaluate your week every single week, look at ineffiences (maybe your sleep hours or when you eat) and optimize your plan for the coming week.

### Remember, all that matters is 1% a day.
