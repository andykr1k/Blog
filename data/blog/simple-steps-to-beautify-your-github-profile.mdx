# Step One: Intialize a repo

The name of the repository should match your username. My github username is andykr1k. I'll name my repo andykr1k as well.

# Step Two: Create README.md

Once you have created the repository, create a file named README.md(case doesn't matter).

# Step Three: Beautification

Go to https://shields.io and follow the steps to create badges for your personal profile! Every time you create a badge, make sure to paste into your README. After doing so, donâ€™t forget to push your changes to GitHub!
