## Effectiveness vs Efficiency

Many wonder what to measure when evaluating your daily or weekly productivity. Some believe how efficient you are when working is more important than how effective your work is. Some believe otherwise.

Whether you are an accountant, a medic, a nba player or an optometrist, at the end of the day we are all people. People who desire pleasure and stimulation. With this in mind, we need to not only evaluate our goals but also what we do to achieve them outside of our professional careers. 

I would never vote for a president who cannot keep his wife happy. Presidents require selflessness, empathy, and many more traits that can be evaluated through their personal lives. If you cannot practice discpline in your personal life, you will not be able to in your professional life. 

Now that you know your goals and know that you must stay consistent throughout your day, you must figure out how to achieve these goals. Measuring effevtiveness will produce processes that achieve your goals; however, timing is not implemented into the strategy when thinking of effectiveness. However, when calculatiing efficiency you are correlating your effectiveness to the time spent to produce that level of effectiveness.
